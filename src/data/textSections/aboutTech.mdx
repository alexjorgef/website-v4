I love working with modern technologies, building and designing awesome projects. I prefer minimalistic and clean designs with a strong user experience. I'm focused in achieving a better problem-solving method for challenging tasks.

I develop both client and server side software, specialized in <b className="text-primary lined-link">backend/infrastructure</b> and <b className="text-primary lined-link">cross-platform development</b>, my interest areas are <b className="text-primary lined-link">data science</b>, <b className="text-primary lined-link">blockchain networks</b>, <b className="text-primary lined-link">distributed computing</b> and <b className="text-primary lined-link">artificial intelligence</b> systems.

Trying to achieve a balance between <b className="text-primary lined-link">automation</b>, <b className="text-primary lined-link">tooling</b>, good <b className="text-primary lined-link">design patterns</b> and <b className="text-primary lined-link">performance</b>.
