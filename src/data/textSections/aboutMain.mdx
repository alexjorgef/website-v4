I'm a developer from <b className="text-primary lined-link">Portugal</b>, living in the beautiful and charming city of Leiria.

Personally my aainterests revolve around <b className="text-primary lined-link">music</b>, <b className="text-primary lined-link">photography</b> and computer graphics.

In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends. I'm also a camping lover, love to go hiking and visit new places.
